• Overleaf automatically detects LaTeX files
• You don't need a .bib file for this report (references are in-text)
• Use the "Logs" tab to debug any compilation errors
• Share your project using the "Share" button
• Use "History" to track changes and revert if needed

IMAGE REFERENCE

All images are referenced in main.tex using:
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{images/step1/filename.png}

If images don't show:
1. Ensure folder names match exactly (case-sensitive on Linux)
2. Check that file extensions are correct (.png, .jpg)
3. Look at error messages in "Logs" tab
